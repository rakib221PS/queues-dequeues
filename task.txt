Implement the queue.
Implement the deque.
Create a header file for both of these data structures.
Read a file with the following structure

front 1
back  2
front 3
front 4
back  7
back  8
front 9
into a deque. Every time the string says "front", please insert the number in the same line using push_front. Every time the string says "back", please insert it using push_back. Print the data structure from the start to end.

Download and read the file cities.json from https://math.uni.lodz.pl/~rogalski/cities.json, which is a json array containing json objects. Every json object contains latitudes, longitudes, populations an city names. Unfortunately, the population data is highly incomplete. Cities which have a population of -1, have no population iformation. Please read the file in. Please push cities which have a population that is not equal to -1 into a queue of City.
